Aam means "All about me". It is a lightweight about me site generator. To compare with blog, Aam is for pages not posts. So you can use it to build your own pages to introduce everything about you.

This site is designed by whtsky. You can get this theme from [Github](https://github.com/whtsky/catsup-theme-clean). It's under MIT License.

Aam aims at building a site to show your information concisely. That can help others know you and understand you.

I will make aam more and more perfect and powerful.

The features in future:

* Biography Page
* Show your Github Repo
* Message Board
* More
